# Inventory-Management-Robot
Efficient inventory management is essential for modern warehouses, retail stores, and supply chains
where speed, accuracy, and automation are crucial. With this project we tried to implement a Smart
Inventory Management System that integrates YOLOv5 for object detection, the Google Speech API
for voice recognition, Raspberry Pi for processing, Arduino for control, and a 6-DOF robotic hand
for automated object handling.
The system employs YOLOv5 to detect and locate objects within a defined stoppage, enabling
real-time tracking of inventory items. Voice commands, processed via the Google Speech API, allow
users to interact with the system hands-free, facilitating dynamic control of inventory operations.
The Raspberry Pi coordinates the detection, recognition, and control processes, while the Arduino
drives the movements of the 6-DOF robotic hand, enabling precise picking, sorting, and placement
of items.
By combining computer vision, voice recognition, and robotics, this system offers a versatile and
user-friendly approach to inventory management. It reduces human intervention, enhances
operational efficiency, and provides an intuitive, voice-controlled interface for streamlined
warehouse automation
